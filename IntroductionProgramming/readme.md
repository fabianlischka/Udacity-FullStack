# Movie project

This is a Udacity project to create little movie trailer website.

To add movies, edit `entertainment_center.py`.

To run (using python 2, not 3), just execute on the CLI:

`python entertainment_center.py`

It'll create a (static) website called fresh_tomatoes.html and open it for
you in the default webbrowser.
