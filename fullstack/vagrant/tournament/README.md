# Tournament

A project for the Udacity course [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud197)

Implement a database to store players and match results for a tournament, 
and implement the Swiss system to determine the pairings for the next round.

# Usage

* `tournament.sql` contains what's necessary to set up the database and views.
* `tournament.py` implements the API to create, delete players, record matches, and 
  suggest next pairings
* `tournament_test.py` runs some tests to check the functionality.
