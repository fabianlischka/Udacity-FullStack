# exercise 1 project for the Udacity course "Full Stack Foundations"
# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud088/l-4325204629/m-4294324434

# create a db for shelters and puppies, and execute some queries

# to run:
# in the terminal:
cd /Users/frl/Documents/Meins/Uni/Udacity/FullStack/fullstack/vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
# if you want to start from scratch, delete puppy/puppies.db
# in that shell to the vagrant VM:
python
# in python:
python puppypopulator.py # if you've deleted puppies.db
python puppyqueries.py


# Exercise 1: create database_setup.py to define the objects and tables,
# then populate using puppypopulator.py
# Exercise 2: run some queries, see puppyqueries.py
# Exercise 3: implement some Associations:
#   one-to-one: add extra table, 1-1 relationship
#   (see http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/basic_relationships.html#one-to-one ),
#   and idealiter use migration tool to migrate
#     specifically, add
##        url to the puppyâ€™s photo,
##        a description about the puppy, and
##        any special needs
#   https://sqlalchemy-migrate.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
#   (here might just recreate the db)
#   many-to-many:
#   see http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/basic_relationships.html#many-to-many

# set up migration
# 0: install sqlalchemy-migrate
sudo pip install sqlalchemy-migrate
# 1: create repo
migrate create puppy_repository "PuppyProject"
# 2: put db in repo
python puppy_repository/manage.py version_control sqlite:///puppies.db puppy_repository
# 2b: set repo and URL
migrate manage manage.py --repository=puppy_repository --url=sqlite:///puppies.db
# (3: optional: check current DB version)
python puppy_repository/manage.py db_version sqlite:///puppies.db puppy_repository
# (3b: easier if 1b has been done)
python manage.py db_version
# (4b: check highest version available)
python manage.py version
# 5. Add first migration script
python manage.py script "Add profile table"
# 6. Edit the created rump script:
open puppy_repository/versions/001_Add_profile_table.py -a Atom
